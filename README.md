The purpose of Online Food Ordering System is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipmentâ€™s and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.

Online Food Ordering System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus, it will help organization in better utilization of resources. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach the information.

The project took a long time to complete. It was attempted to incorporate as many features as feasible within the time constraints. The Functional Requirements were met satisfactorily. Some of the system's non-functional requirements have not been implemented. These requirements are the most important and reflect the most important qualities. Due to time constraints, some needs are not implemented. However, because they are lower priority features, their loss would not cause substantial operational concerns. In
the future, these functionalities may be introduced.
